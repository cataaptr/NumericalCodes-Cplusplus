# ðŸ§® Numerical Codes
  This project is written in C++ and converts a digit from the code 0-9 to 8421, 2421, 84~(21), 50 43210, Excess3, Gray, 74210.

# ðŸ“Œ Steps
1. The menu appears
2. The user must select if he wants to display the codes for all characters or for only one
3. If he selects the display of a single character, he must enter a corresponding number (0-9)

# ðŸ”¥ What I learned
- Better handling of bits
- Binary Conversion Algorithms
